# 🌱 Lucky Shrub – SQL Stored Procedures Practice

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my SQL practice using the **Lucky Shrub** database.  
The focus of this exercise is on creating and calling **stored procedures** that retrieve and analyze data from an `Orders_2` table.  

Stored procedures are essential in SQL for reusability, parameterized queries, and simplifying complex logic.  
In this practice, I gradually increased the difficulty of tasks by moving from simple retrieval to parameterized filtering and aggregations.

## 🗂️ Dataset
I created a sample `Orders_2` table that simulates client orders:

| OrderID | ClientID | ProductID | Quantity | Cost  |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1       | Cl1      | P1        | 10       | 500   |
| 2       | Cl2      | P2        | 5        | 100   |
| 3       | Cl3      | P3        | 20       | 800   |
| 4       | Cl4      | P4        | 15       | 150   |
| 5       | Cl3      | P3        | 10       | 450   |
| 6       | Cl2      | P2        | 5        | 800   |
| 7       | Cl1      | P4        | 22       | 1200  |
| 8       | Cl1      | P1        | 15       | 150   |
